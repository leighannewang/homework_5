Homework 5
================

## Problem 1

**Read in the homicide dataset**

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

The raw dataset shows us information on homicides in 50 U.S. cities; it
contains variables such as id, city/state and latitude and longitude for
the location of the murder, date of reported crime, and information
about the victim such as name, race, age, and sex.

We created a city\_state variable and are looking at each case based on
whether or not they are solved/unsolved.

**Looking at the dataset**

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

In this step we are summarizing to obtain number of unsolved and total
homicides in each city\_state.

**Proportion test for Baltimore, MD:**

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
## # A tibble: 1 x 8
##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided
```

**Iterate the proportion test for each city:**

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

**Plot:**

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

**Read in all datasets and create tidy dataframe**

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data/study")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/study/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x)) # reading in datasets
  ) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_replace(path, "data/study/", ""),
    id = path,
    id = str_replace(id, ".csv", ""),
  ) %>% # pivot longer to tidy data
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.numeric(week)
  ) %>% 
  select(-path)
```

**Create spaghetti plot and comment on group differences**

``` r
path_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = id)) +
  geom_line()
```

From the plot we can see that the control observation values are lower
than the experimental groupâ€™s observations. Although there are
variations between the different control subjects and experimental
subjects, overall control observations fall under values 3-4 and under
while experimental observations are mostly above 2.5.
